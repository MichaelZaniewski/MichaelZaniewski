## Hi ğŸ‘‹ My name is Michael Zaniewski 

My goal is to become a Business Analyst in the Aviation Industry and leverage my previous experience working with airlines. I have a Bachelors of Science degree in Marketing and a data-driven mindset.

I'm currently working on an airline-delay project utilizing SQL to determine what an airline can improve to increase on-time departures. Open to collaboration!
